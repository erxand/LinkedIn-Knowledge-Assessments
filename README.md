# LinkedIn-Knowledge-Assessments

# Overview

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with LinkedIn and LinkedIn Learning, as they are both tools that can help further my career and understanding of my field.


# Development Environment

My university has given us access to LinkedIn Learning free of cost, I decided to take advantage of that. I want to become proficient enough to pass the skill assessments on LinkedIn, so I spent time with LinkedIn Learning to gain those skills.

# Future Work

The skill assessments were much harder than anticipated, I think helps add to the validity of the LinkedIn certifications. The primary three skills I want to achieve are:
* Git
* Agile Methodologies
* Object-Oriented Programming
Each of these have associated LinkedIn learning courses that I would like to complete in the future.

I also did research into what other courses were on LinkedIn Learning, even if they didn't have associated skill assessments. These are courses that I would like to take in the future, they're either skills I'm personally interested in having, or they're skills that companies I would like to work at want me to have.
